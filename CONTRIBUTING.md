# Contribution Guidelines

---

Your contributions are always welcome! 🚀

This project aims to help developers discover and contribute to real-world, production-grade open-source **Node.js** backends built with **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**. Whether it's Express, NestJS, Fastify, or Serverless — we want it here.

---

## ✅ Guideline

1. **Check before submitting**:
   - Look through existing suggestions, issues, and PRs to avoid duplicates.
2. **Add links in this format**:
   - `[Project Name](https://example.com) – Short and clear description ending with a period.`
3. **Keep it categorized**:
   - Add projects under the correct category (e.g., CMS, API Boilerplate, Kafka-based, etc.)
4. **Keep it clean**:
   - Fix spelling/grammar
   - No trailing whitespace
   - One link per Pull Request
5. **Pull Request format**:
   - PR title: `Add project-name`
   - Include a short reason why it's awesome or relevant to the Node.js backend space.

## 🔁 Updating Existing Links or Categories
